    "- Human Activity Recognition with Wearables (e.g. running, lying down, driving or sitting)\n",
    "- Elderly fall/accident/emergency alert system\n",
    "- Possible Consumer Applications, for example:\n",
    "    - Gym Repetition Counter: identify exercise and count the reps based on wearables\n",
    "    - Parkinson Disease Early Detection system\n",
    "- Also broadly related with distributed training applications such a self-driving cars (e.g. Tesla Object recognition model [[1]](#References))"
